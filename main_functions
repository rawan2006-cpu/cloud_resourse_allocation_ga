


1) Simulation environment:
   - acts as the virtual world or system where potential solutions evolve
   - models hosts, VMs and tasks (entities.py)

   1. initialization
   2. Evaluation
   3. Selection
   4. reproduction
   5. Iteration life (2-4 repeat)



2)  Genetic Algorithm:
   Evolves population of resource allocation solutions using:
   - selection, crossover and mutation (ga_core.py)
3) fitness evaluation:
   Measures solution quality based on metrics like energy consumption, resource utilization, and task completion (fitness.py)

4) Baselines:
  Implements heuristic algorithms for comparison (heuristics.py)

5) Experiment runner:
  Automates experiments and collects results (runner.py)

6) Web demo:
  provides a Flask-based interface for live demonstration (web_demo/app.py)

7) Data handling:
  Loads real and synthetic workload traces (data/)

8) Visualization:
  (notebooks/demo_notebook.ipynb)
