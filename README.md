# Cloud Resource Allocation using Genetic Algorithm

This project implements a cloud resource allocation simulator using a Genetic Algorithm (GA).
It compares GA-based optimization with baseline scheduling heuristics such as First-Fit and Round-Robin.

## Features
- Cloud simulation (Tasks, VMs, Hosts)
- Energy-aware scheduling
- Genetic Algorithm optimizer
- Baseline schedulers
- Experimental runner
- Web-based demo using Flask
