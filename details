
Use a Genetic Algorithm to map cloud tasks/VMs to physical hosts (or schedule tasks onto VMs) to optimize multi-objective goals such as minimizing energy consumption, reducing makespan/response time, and maximizing resource utilization.

- resource-allocation system (simulator + GA optimizer) that takes a workload (task/jobs trace or synthetic jobs) and produces an assignment/placement strategy. The GA will produce candidate allocations (chromosomes) and evolve them to optimize a fitness function that balances multiple objectives (e.g., energy, cost, response time, SLA violations, utilization).

- VM placement / consolidation — allocate existing VMs to physical hosts and migrate/ consolidate to save energy while respecting CPU/RAM/io constraints.

- classification with a small NN to pre-group tasks then GA for assignment

cloud computing environments require
 -> efficient allocation of computational resources (cpu, memory) to virtual machines (VM) and tasks

the goal is
- to optimize resource usage
- minimize energy consumption
- ensure quality of service

This project implements a genetic algoritm to solve the resource allocation problem in a simulated environment

The GA searches for near-optimal mappings of tasks to VMs and VMs to hosts, considering constraints like CPU/ Memory capacity and power consumption
